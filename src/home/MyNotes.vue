            <p>	v-if vs v-show
                Use v-if if elemnt is not expensive to re-render, like a simple span element
                Use v-show (display:none) for expensive elements such as a components with children components  with children components

            <p> /* eslint-disable */ v-for with v-if Note that itâ€™s not recommended to use v-if and v-for together
                your intent is to conditionally skip execution of the loop, you can place the v-if on a wrapper element

            <p>	https://vue-loader.vuejs.org/guide/scoped-css.html
            If style is scoped Vue wont affect child components, but CSS inheritance such as color, might affect child components but that is CSS inheritance applying those styles, not Vue.
            <br/>
            In a parent component you do have access to classes from child components if you need to style them from the parent component.
            <br/>
            Some pre-processors, such as Sass, may not be able to parse >>> properly. In those cases you can use the /deep/ or ::v-deep combinator instead - both are aliases for >>> and work exactly the same
